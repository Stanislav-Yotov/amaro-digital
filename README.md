Amaro Digital is a boutique digital PR agency that works with a handful of businesses to deliver exceptional results.

For building Amaro digital I've used React.js together with bootstrap.
I've also used external libraries like:

-react-intersection-observer - for activating the blog animation when the blog comes to the viewport,
-react scroll - for smootly transitioning to the section that is clicked,
-rerousel - for the animated infinite carousel with the company partners logos,
-emails.js - for sending the information from the contact form to the Amaro team.
